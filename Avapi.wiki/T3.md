## What T3 does?
This API returns the triple exponential moving average (T3) values. The related REST API documentation is [here](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#t3)  

***
## Including the T3 namespace
The very first thing to do before diving into T3 calls is to include the right namespace.  

```

using Avapi.AvapiT3

```

## How to get a T3 object?
The T3 object is retrieved from the Connection object.  

The snippet below shows how to get the Connection object:
```

...
IAvapiConnection connection = AvapiConnection.Instance
connection.Connect("Your Alpha Vantage API Key !!!!");
...

```
Once you got the Connection object you can extract the T3 from it.
```

...
Int_T3 t3 = 
	connection.GetQueryObject_T3();

```

## Perform a T3 Request
To perform a T3 request you have 2 options:
1. **The request with constants**:

```

IAvapiResponse_T3 Query(string symbol,
		T3_interval interval,
		int time_period,
		T3_series_type series_type);

```  

2. **The request without constants**:

```

IAvapiResponse_T3 Query(string symbol,
		string interval,
		string time_period,
		string series_type);

```  

### Parameters
The parameters below are needed to perform the T3 request.  
* **symbol**: The name of the equity
* **interval**: The time interval between two consecutive data points in the time series.
* **time_period**: Number of data points used to calculate each moving average value.
* **series_type**: The price type in the time series. The types supported are: close, open, high, low

Please notice that the info above are copied from the official alphavantage documentation, that you can find [here](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/).  

***
## The request with constants
The request with constants implies the use of different enums:
* **T3_interval**
* **T3_series_type**

**T3_interval**: The time interval between two consecutive data points in the time series.
```  

public enum T3_interval
{
	none,
	n_1min,
	n_5min,
	n_15min,
	n_30min,
	n_60min,
	daily,
	weekly,
	monthly
}

```  
**T3_series_type**: The price type in the time series. The types supported are: close, open, high, low
```  

public enum T3_series_type
{
	none,
	close,
	open,
	high,
	low
}

```  
  

***
## T3 Response
The response of a T3 request is an object that implements the **IAvapiResponse_T3** interface.
```

public interface IAvapiResponse_T3
{
    string RowData
    {
        get;
    }
    IAvapiResponse_T3_Content Data
    {
        get;
    }
}

```
The **IAvapiResponse_T3** interface has two members: RowData and Data.
* **RowData**: represents the json response in string format.
* **Data**: it is not implemented yet, but it represents the parsed response in an object implementing the interface **IAvapiResponse_T3_Content**.

## Complete Example: Display the result of a T3 request
```

using System;
using System.IO;
using Avapi.AvapiT3;

namespace Avapi
{
    public class Example
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            // Creating the connection object
            IAvapiConnection connection = AvapiConnection.Instance;

            // Set up the connection and pass the API_KEY provided by alphavantage.co
            connection.Connect("Your Alpha Vantage API Key !!!!");

            // Get the T3 query object
            Int_T3 t3 =
                connection.GetQueryObject_T3();

            // Perform the T3 request and get the result
            IAvapiResponse_T3 t3Response = 
            t3.Query(
                 "MSFT",
                 Const_T3.T3_interval.n_1min,
                 10,
                 Const_T3.T3_series_type.close);

            // Printout the results
            Console.WriteLine("******** RAW DATA T3 ********");
            Console.WriteLine(t3Response.RowData);

```
